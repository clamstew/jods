# Cursor Rules Workflow

When working with Cursor rules in this project:

## Rule Structure

- Cursor rules are stored in `.cursor/rules/` directory as `.mdc` files
- Each rule must have proper MDC metadata at the top:
  ```
  ---
  description: Brief description of what this rule does
  globs: optional/glob/patterns/*.ts
  alwaysApply: true or false
  ---
  ```

## Best Practices

1. **NEVER create new markdown files** in the docs directory as a substitute for editing rule files
2. **Always check if a rule exists** in `.cursor/rules/*.mdc` before creating a new one
3. **Update existing rules** rather than duplicating content
4. **Use the `@filename` syntax** to reference supporting files
5. **Keep rules focused** on a specific aspect of the codebase

## Common Issues

- If you can't locate a rule, use `find .cursor -name "*.mdc"` to see all rule files
- Use proper MDC format with the metadata section (the part between `---` lines)
- If updating a rule with the editor doesn't work, you can use terminal commands to recreate the file
