# Cursor Rules Workflow

When working with Cursor rules in this project:

## Rule Structure

- Cursor rules are stored in `.cursor/rules/` directory as `.mdc` files
- Each rule must have proper MDC metadata at the top:
  ```
  ---
  description: Brief description of what this rule does
  globs: optional/glob/patterns/*.ts
  alwaysApply: true or false
  ---
  ```

## Creating MDC Files with Chat Agents

**IMPORTANT**: When creating or editing MDC files via the chat agent:

1. **ALWAYS include the metadata header** - This is REQUIRED for the rule to function properly
2. The metadata section MUST include these three fields:
   - `description`: A brief description of the rule's purpose
   - `globs`: Array or string pattern for which files the rule applies to
   - `alwaysApply`: Boolean indicating if rule should apply to all sessions
3. Ensure the metadata is formatted correctly with triple dashes at the beginning and end
4. Cursor will NOT recognize the file as a valid rule without this metadata

Example of CORRECT metadata:
```
---
description: Guidelines for component design patterns
globs: ["**/*.tsx", "**/*.jsx"]
alwaysApply: false
---
```

## Best Practices

1. **NEVER create new markdown files** in the docs directory as a substitute for editing rule files
2. **Always check if a rule exists** in `.cursor/rules/*.mdc` before creating a new one
3. **Update existing rules** rather than duplicating content
4. **Use the `@filename` syntax** to reference supporting files
5. **Keep rules focused** on a specific aspect of the codebase

## Common Issues

- If you can't locate a rule, use `find .cursor -name "*.mdc"` to see all rule files
- Use proper MDC format with the metadata section (the part between `---` lines)
- If updating a rule with the editor doesn't work, you can use terminal commands to recreate the file
- If a rule isn't being applied, check that the metadata header is complete and correctly formatted
