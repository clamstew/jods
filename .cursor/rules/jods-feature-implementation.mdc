# jods Feature Implementation Guidelines

You're helping implement a new feature for jods (JSON On Demand Store), a minimal reactive state library for JavaScript.

## Context

jods is a zero-dependency reactive state management library that provides:

- Reactive store with subscription
- JSON snapshots with `json()`
- Computed values with `computed()`
- Diff detection with `diff()`
- Time-travel debugging with `history()`
- Framework integrations (React, Preact)

## Implementation Checklist

When adding a new feature to jods, ensure you update the following:

1. **Core Implementation**
   - Add implementation file in `src/` directory
   - Export the feature from `src/index.ts`
   - Add TypeScript types and interfaces

2. **Testing**
   - Create unit tests in `src/__tests__/`
   - Include edge case testing
   - Update existing tests if behavior changes

3. **Documentation**
   - Update README.md:
     - Add to "Features" section
     - Add to "API" section
     - Add example if applicable
     - Update Roadmap if previously listed
   - Update docs site:
     - Add dedicated page for significant features
     - Update API reference page
     - Add examples

4. **Examples**
   - Create example file in `examples/` directory
   - Ensure examples are well-commented
   - Show best practices

5. **Framework Integration**
   - Update React hooks in `src/react/` if applicable
   - Update Preact hooks in `src/preact/` if applicable
   - Update Remix hooks in `src/remix/` if applicable
   - Provide examples of framework usage

## Style Guidelines
- Keep implementations small, focused and composable
- Maintain zero dependencies
- Use existing patterns for reactivity
- Provide comprehensive TypeScript types
- Follow existing code style
- Minimize bundle size impact

## Common Issues
- Ensure both ESM and CJS builds include the new feature
- Check that all TypeScript types are exported
- Verify examples work in isolation
- Ensure computed values work correctly with the new feature
- Check JSON snapshots include new features appropriately

Refer to the maintainers-guide.md in the docs site for more detailed guidance.
