# Design Iterations System

The Design Iterations system is a powerful workflow that combines Playwright screenshots with AI assistance to rapidly evolve UI components through multiple iterations.

## AI-Driven Workflow

When a user asks about design iterations, you should:

1. **Understand their target component** - Common targets include:

   - `hero-section` - Main hero section on homepage
   - `features-section` - Features grid on homepage
   - `framework-section-react` - React framework comparison
   - `framework-section-remix` - Remix framework section
   - `compare-section` - Library comparison section

2. **Interpret design direction** - Extract design goals from their prompt:

   - Visual style (minimal, bold, modern, elegant)
   - Spacing preferences (tight, spacious, balanced)
   - Color themes (vibrant, subtle, monochrome, gradients)
   - Typography focus (improved hierarchy, readability)
   - Special elements (animations, interactions, visuals)

3. **Run appropriate commands** using the consistent syntax:

   - Generate iterations: `pnpm design-iterations:count-3 --target="component-name" --prompt="design direction"`
   - Generate refined iteration: `pnpm design-iterations:refine --target="component-name"`
   - Apply iteration: `pnpm design-iterations:apply --iteration=N --target="component-name"`
   - Check status: `pnpm design-iterations:status`
   - Cleanup: `pnpm design-iterations:cleanup`

4. **Guide through the workflow**:
   - Explain where to find screenshots (both in `static/screenshots/unified/` and `temp/design-iterations/iteration-N/screenshots/`)
   - Help interpret the different iterations
   - Guide on providing effective feedback
   - Recommend refinements based on feedback
   - Assist with applying the final design

## Command Examples

```bash
# Generate 3 initial iterations with specific design direction
pnpm design-iterations:count-3 --target="features-section" --prompt="Create a modern design with improved spacing and subtle gradients"

# Generate a refined iteration based on feedback
pnpm design-iterations:refine --target="features-section"

# Apply the chosen design
pnpm design-iterations:apply --iteration=2 --target="features-section"
```

## Best Practices

1. Start with 3-5 distinct design approaches
2. Provide specific, actionable feedback for each iteration
3. Review both light and dark mode versions
4. Consider mobile responsiveness
5. Use design vocabulary in feedback to clarify intentions
6. Rate iterations numerically to track preferences
7. Clean up old iterations periodically

## Common Issues

- If screenshots aren't generating, recommend:
  - Check Playwright installation: `npx playwright install chromium`
  - Try verbose logging: `DEBUG=1 pnpm design-iterations --count=1 --target="features-section"`
  - Ensure docs site is running: `pnpm start`

- If applying designs fails:
  - Check for uncommitted changes: `git status`
  - Try force flag: `pnpm design-iterations:apply --iteration=N --target="component-name" --force`
