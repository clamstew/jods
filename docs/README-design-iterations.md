# Design Iteration Process for jods Documentation 🎨 🔄

## Overview 🔍

This repository contains tools and documentation for managing design iterations for the jods documentation site. The goal is to provide a structured approach to exploring and implementing design improvements while maintaining a record of changes and feedback.

```

## Quick Start ⚡

1. **Review the workflow documentation:** 📝

   ```
   docs/design-iteration-workflow.md
   ```

2. **Run the design iterations script:** 🚀

   ```bash
   node docs/scripts/design-iterations.mjs --count=3 --target="framework-section-remix"
   ```

3. **Review the generated screenshots and provide feedback** 👀 using the generated feedback template

4. **Apply selected iteration** after maintainer approval: ✅
   ```javascript
   import { applySelectedIteration } from "./docs/scripts/design-iterations.mjs";
   applySelectedIteration("./docs/temp/design-iterations/iteration-2");
   ```

## Key Features ✨

- **Multiple design iterations** 🔄 - Systematically explore different design approaches
- **Screenshot capture** 📸 - Automatically capture screenshots of each iteration
- **Git diff preservation** 💾 - Save exact implementation details for each iteration
- **Feedback templates** 📋 - Structured approach to collecting and analyzing feedback
- **Maintainer approval** 👍 - Required sign-off before baseline changes
- **Comprehensive documentation** 📚 - Guidelines for the entire process

## Workflow Summary 🔄

1. **Planning** 🗓️ - Identify design targets and goals
2. **Implementation** 🛠️ - Create distinct design variations
3. **Documentation** 📝 - Capture screenshots and implementation details
4. **Review** 🔍 - Analyze strengths and weaknesses of each approach
5. **Selection** ✅ - Choose and refine preferred design
6. **Implementation** 🚀 - Apply selected design with maintainer approval

## Best Practices 💯

1. Always save Git diffs after taking screenshots 📸 💾
2. Document feedback promptly using the provided templates 📋 ⏱️
3. Never change the baseline without explicit maintainer approval 🔒 👍
4. Keep iterations focused on specific design goals 🎯
5. Preserve all screenshots and diffs for reference 📚

## Tool Usage 🧰

### Design Iterations Script 📜

The main script (`design-iterations.mjs`) automates many aspects of the process:

```bash
# Basic usage
node docs/scripts/design-iterations.mjs

# Generate multiple iterations for specific components
node docs/scripts/design-iterations.mjs --count=3 --target="hero-section,features-section"

# Skip signoff requirement (for testing only)
node docs/scripts/design-iterations.mjs --signoff=false
```

## Contribution Guidelines 🤝

When contributing design improvements:

1. Follow the established workflow 🛤️
2. Use the provided templates and tools 🧰
3. Focus on developer experience and brand consistency 👩‍💻
4. Ensure accessibility is maintained ♿
5. Consider both dark and light themes 🌓

## Example Usage 💡

See `docs/examples/remix-section-design-feedback.md` for a complete example of the design iteration feedback process.
