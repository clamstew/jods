# Design Iteration Workflow

## Overview

This document outlines the workflow for creating, reviewing, and implementing design iterations for the jods documentation site. It serves as a guide for both maintainers and AI collaborators to ensure a consistent and effective approach to design improvements.

## Design Iteration Process

### 1. Planning Phase

- Identify sections or components that would benefit from design improvements
- Define clear goals for each design iteration (e.g., improved readability, better code presentation)
- Determine the number of design variations to explore (typically 3)

### 2. Implementation Phase

- Create distinct design variations through CSS modifications
- Implement each variation separately, focusing on specific aspects
- Capture screenshots of each variation for both light and dark themes
- **Important:** After each screenshot is captured, save the Git diff of the changes

### 3. Review Phase

- Review each design variation individually
- Document feedback for each variation in the accompanying `design-iteration-feedback.md` file
- Identify strengths and weaknesses of each approach
- If appropriate, suggest combinations of elements from different iterations

### 4. Implementation Phase

- Based on feedback, implement the final design
- Create baseline screenshots for future reference
- **Important:** Only a project maintainer can approve baseline changes

## Technical Implementation

### Capturing Git Diffs

After taking screenshots for each design iteration, capture the current Git diff to preserve the implementation details:

```bash
# After taking screenshots
git diff > docs/temp/possible-diffs/iteration-N.diff
```

This ensures that even if the code changes continue, we maintain a record of the exact changes that produced each screenshot.

### Directory Structure

```
docs/
├── temp/
│   └── possible-diffs/        # Git diffs for each iteration
├── static/
│   └── screenshots/
│       └── unified/           # Screenshots of design iterations
└── design-iteration-feedback.md  # Feedback on each iteration
```

### Version Control Considerations

- Do not commit iteration design changes until final approval
- Only commit baseline changes with maintainer sign-off
- Store all diffs and feedback in the repository for historical reference

## Guidelines for AI Collaborators

When working with AI tools to create design iterations:

1. **Do not change the baseline** without explicit maintainer approval
2. Save all Git diffs after each screenshot to preserve implementation details
3. Maintain a separate markdown file that collects feedback on each iteration
4. When presenting iterations to maintainers, include details about:
   - What design elements were changed
   - The reasoning behind each change
   - How the change aligns with jods branding and developer experience goals
5. Keep track of all screenshots discussed during review conversations

## Common Pitfalls to Avoid

1. **Excessive design changes** that dramatically alter the visual identity
2. **Neglecting accessibility** in design iterations
3. **Inconsistent dark/light theme implementations**
4. **Changing the baseline** without explicit approval
5. **Losing track of implementation details** by not saving diffs

## Conclusion

Following this workflow ensures that design iterations are systematic, well-documented, and preserve all necessary implementation details. Each iteration should represent a thoughtful approach to improving the documentation site while maintaining brand consistency and developer focus.
