# üì∏ Documentation Screenshots

This guide explains how to use Playwright to generate consistent, automated screenshots of the jods documentation site for review and marketing purposes.

## Overview

The documentation site includes a Playwright-based screenshot system that:

1. Captures full-page screenshots of key pages
2. Captures targeted component screenshots for focused UI testing
3. Automatically captures both light and dark themes
4. Organizes screenshots with timestamped filenames
5. Works with both local development and production environments
6. Preserves baseline images for comparison during design iterations
7. Provides tools to manage and clean up screenshot history

## üìä Available Commands

From the root project directory:

```bash
# Take full-page screenshots of the local development site
pnpm docs:screenshot:homepage

# Take component-focused screenshots of the local development site
pnpm docs:screenshot:component

# Create baseline screenshots (without timestamps)
pnpm docs:screenshot:baseline

# Clean up all timestamped screenshots
pnpm docs:screenshot:cleanup

# Clean up old screenshots but keep the 3 most recent batches
pnpm docs:screenshot:cleanup:keep-latest

# Take screenshots of the production site
pnpm docs:screenshot:production
```

From the docs directory:

```bash
# Take full-page screenshots of the local development site
pnpm homepage:screenshot

# Take component-focused screenshots
pnpm screenshot:component

# Create baseline screenshots (without timestamps)
pnpm screenshot:baseline

# Take screenshots of the production site
pnpm production:screenshot
```

## üìÅ Screenshot Output

Full-page screenshots are saved to:

```
docs/static/screenshots/
```

Component screenshots are saved to:

```
docs/static/screenshots/components/
```

With the following naming format for new screenshots:

```
# Full page screenshots
[page-name]-[theme]-[YYYYMMDD-HHMMSS].png

# Component screenshots
[component-name]-[theme]-[YYYYMMDD-HHMMSS].png
```

For example:

- `homepage-light-20240615-134527.png`
- `homepage-dark-20240615-134527.png`
- `hero-section-light-20240615-134527.png`
- `hero-section-dark-20240615-134527.png`

The baseline images (without timestamps) are:

- `homepage-light.png`
- `homepage-dark.png`
- `hero-section-light.png`
- `hero-section-dark.png`

This approach allows you to track design changes over time and compare new versions with the original baseline without overwriting important reference images.

## üîß How It Works

The screenshot system uses Playwright, a browser automation library, to:

1. Launch a headless Chromium browser
2. Navigate to each configured page
3. Toggle between light and dark themes using the site's theme toggle button
4. Take full-page or component-specific screenshots in both themes
5. Save images with timestamped filenames to preserve version history

## üîç Component Screenshots

Component screenshots capture specific UI elements rather than entire pages, which is helpful for:

1. Focused UI testing of specific components
2. Comparing design changes to isolated UI elements
3. More efficient visual regression testing
4. Creating component-specific documentation

Components are defined in `docs/scripts/screenshot-component.mjs`:

```js
const COMPONENTS = [
  {
    page: "/",
    name: "hero-section",
    selector: ".hero__title",
    padding: 100, // Extra padding around element in pixels
  },
  {
    page: "/",
    name: "features-section",
    selector: ".features",
    padding: 50,
  },
  // Add more components as needed
];
```

## ‚öôÔ∏è Configuration

### Full Page Screenshots

Full page screenshots are configured in `docs/scripts/screenshot.mjs`.

To add a new page, edit the `PAGES` array:

```js
const PAGES = [
  { path: "/", name: "homepage" },
  { path: "/intro", name: "intro" },
  { path: "/api-reference", name: "api-reference" },
  // Add your new page here
  { path: "/your-page", name: "your-page-name" },
];
```

### Component Screenshots

Component screenshots are configured in `docs/scripts/screenshot-component.mjs`.

To add a new component, edit the `COMPONENTS` array:

```js
const COMPONENTS = [
  {
    page: "/",
    name: "hero-section",
    selector: ".hero__title",
    padding: 100,
  },
  // Add your new component here
  {
    page: "/your-page",
    name: "your-component-name",
    selector: ".your-component-selector",
    padding: 50,
  },
];
```

### Path Handling

The system automatically handles path prefixes:

- For localhost environments, it adds `/jods` to the URLs
- For production environments, it uses the base path

### Theme Detection

The system automatically detects and toggles between light and dark themes by:

1. Reading the `data-theme` attribute from the document
2. Clicking the theme toggle button when needed
3. Waiting for the theme transition to complete

## üì∏ Screenshot Management

The screenshot system includes tools to manage your screenshots:

### Creating Baselines

Baseline screenshots are the reference images without timestamps used for comparison:

```bash
# Create all baselines (full-page and component)
pnpm screenshot:baseline

# Create only component baselines
node scripts/screenshot-manager.mjs --create-baselines --components-only

# Create only full-page baselines
node scripts/screenshot-manager.mjs --create-baselines --full-pages-only
```

### Cleaning Up Screenshots

To prevent accumulating too many screenshots, you can clean up old ones:

```bash
# Remove all timestamped screenshots
pnpm screenshot:cleanup

# Keep the 3 most recent batches of screenshots
pnpm screenshot:cleanup:keep-latest

# Only clean up component screenshots
node scripts/screenshot-manager.mjs --cleanup --components-only

# Only clean up full-page screenshots but keep 5 recent batches
node scripts/screenshot-manager.mjs --cleanup --full-pages-only --keep=5
```

## üîÑ Design Versioning and Comparison

The timestamped screenshots enable several workflows for design management:

1. **Design History**: Track how the site's design evolves over time
2. **A/B Comparison**: Compare new iterations with baseline images
3. **Focused Component Testing**: Test specific UI elements without capturing the entire page
4. **Regression Testing**: Identify unintended visual changes
5. **Design Reviews**: Share specific timestamped versions for feedback

To compare design changes with the baselines:

1. Take new screenshots with the updated design (they'll automatically get timestamped)
2. Place the baseline image and new timestamped image side by side
3. Look for differences in layout, colors, typography, spacing, etc.
4. Make further design adjustments as needed and repeat

## ü§î Troubleshooting

If the screenshot system encounters issues:

1. **Connection Issues**: Make sure the documentation site is running locally before taking screenshots
2. **Theme Toggle Issues**: The system uses multiple selectors to find the theme toggle button, but if the site structure changes, you may need to update the selectors in the screenshot scripts
3. **Missing Pages/Components**: Verify that the URLs and selectors match the actual site structure
4. **Disk Space**: If you have many timestamped screenshots, use `pnpm screenshot:cleanup` to free up space

## üîÑ CI/CD Integration

Currently, screenshots must be taken manually. For future CI/CD integration:

1. Add a GitHub Action that generates screenshots on PR
2. Compare screenshots to detect visual regressions
3. Store screenshot history for reference

## üì± Responsive Screenshots

Currently, screenshots are taken at a fixed desktop viewport (1280√ó800). To add responsive screenshots:

1. Add a viewport configuration to the `PAGES` and `COMPONENTS` arrays
2. Create separate screenshot functions for each viewport size
3. Add a naming convention that includes the viewport size

## üß† Best Practices

1. Take screenshots after significant UI changes
2. Use component screenshots for focused testing of specific UI elements
3. Create baseline screenshots before major redesigns for reference
4. Include screenshots in PR descriptions for visual reviews
5. Use screenshots for marketing materials and documentation updates
6. Store screenshot sets for each major release for reference
7. When comparing design changes, always use timestamped versions against baselines
8. Clean up older timestamped screenshots periodically to save space
