# ðŸš€ Getting Started with Screenshots

This guide will help you understand and use our screenshot automation system for documenting and testing the jods UI.

## Overview

The screenshot system lets you:

- Capture screenshots of components in both light and dark themes
- Establish baseline reference images
- Compare new screenshots against baselines to detect visual changes
- Iterate quickly on design changes with visual feedback

## Quick Start

### 1. Capture Screenshots

```bash
# Capture all components
pnpm screenshot

# Capture only specific components
pnpm screenshot -- --components=hero-section,features-section

# Capture only homepage sections
pnpm screenshot -- --mode=sections
```

### 2. Baseline Management

```bash
# Create or update baselines
pnpm screenshot:baseline

# Clean up old screenshots (keeps only the latest)
pnpm screenshot:cleanup
```

### 3. Viewing Results

Screenshots are saved in:

- `static/screenshots/unified` - Component screenshots
- `static/debug` - HTML debug information

## Understanding Screenshot Types

- **Baseline screenshots**: Reference images with no timestamp in filename (e.g., `hero-section-light.png`)
- **Timestamped screenshots**: Images from latest run with timestamps (e.g., `hero-section-light-20230101-123456.png`)
- **Diff images**: Visual differences between baseline and new captures

## Component Configuration

Components are defined in `screenshot-selectors.mjs` with configurations like:

```javascript
{
  name: "hero-section",
  page: "/",
  selector: "[data-testid='jods-hero-section']",
  fallbackStrategy: "keyword-context",
  keywords: ["jods", "Powerful features"],
  padding: 50,
  // ... additional options
}
```

## Common Workflows

### Adding a New Component

1. Add a new component definition to `screenshot-selectors.mjs`
2. Capture it: `pnpm screenshot -- --components=your-new-component`
3. Baseline it: `pnpm screenshot:baseline -- --components=your-new-component`

### Design Iteration Process

1. Make UI changes to a component
2. Run `pnpm screenshot -- --components=changed-component`
3. Compare with baselines to see visual differences
4. When satisfied, update baselines with `pnpm screenshot:baseline -- --components=changed-component`

### Troubleshooting Selectors

If a component can't be captured correctly:

1. Use alternative selectors in the component config
2. Set a `fallbackStrategy` appropriate for the component
3. Use `testid` attributes in your components for reliable selection

## Integration with Design Iterations

The screenshot system is a foundational component of the [Design Iterations workflow](../workflow), allowing you to:

1. Capture baseline screenshots before making design changes
2. Create screenshots of each design iteration
3. Compare iterations visually to select the best approach
4. Document the evolution of your UI components

For detailed information on capturing screenshots during design iterations, see the [Complete Workflow](../workflow#capturing-screenshots) guide.
