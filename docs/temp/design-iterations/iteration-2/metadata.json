      "reasoning": "The updated design fixes the code tab regression where all tabs appeared simultaneously, adds a vibrant Remix Run-inspired rainbow gradient header that better matches the official Remix brand, improves contrast, and adds a subtle rainbow indicator on the active tab. The code container cutoff issue is also resolved with proper spacing."
