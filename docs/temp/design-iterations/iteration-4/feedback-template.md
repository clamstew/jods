#### Feedback

- **What works well:**
  - Concise feature descriptions provide key information
  - Card-based layout creates clean visual organization
  - Title and description hierarchy is clear
  - Links to details provide path to more information
- **What could be improved:**
  - Feature descriptions are too brief to fully communicate value
  - Remix integration description doesn't highlight its unique capabilities
  - Content doesn't emphasize differentiators from PR #22
  - Cards lack context about how features relate to each other
- **General notes:**
  This design iteration proposes a "Content Redesign" approach that enhances the feature descriptions with more detailed, benefit-focused content. The Remix integration would receive an expanded description that clearly communicates its value proposition, including mention of the key new features from PR #22 (defineStore, useJodsForm, withJods, etc.). All descriptions would be enhanced, but the Remix card would include additional bullet points highlighting specific capabilities.

#### Rating: 8/10

## Summary and Decision

### Overall Preferences

- **Favorite component design:** Enhanced content with expanded Remix description
- **Best visual elements:**
  - More detailed, benefit-focused feature descriptions
  - Bullet point highlights for Remix integration
  - "New" badge on Remix integration card

### Implementation Plan

- [ ] Proceed with current designs as is
- [x] Create new iterations with specific focus
- [ ] Combine elements from different iterations

### Additional Notes

Design Iteration 4 focuses on enhancing the content rather than the visual structure. By expanding the feature descriptions and adding specific capability highlights to the Remix integration, this approach communicates more value while maintaining the existing layout. A "New" badge on the Remix card creates immediate visual distinction without requiring major layout changes.

### Baseline Decision

- [ ] Approved for baseline update
- [ ] Not approved for baseline update
- [x] Pending additional refinements before baseline approval

_Note: Baseline changes require maintainer signoff_
