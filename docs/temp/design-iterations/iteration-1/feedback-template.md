#### Feedback

- **What works well:**
  - The current grid layout provides good separation between features
  - Emoji icons create a playful, approachable aesthetic
  - Simple color scheme maintains focus on content
  - Feature cards have good hover effects
- **What could be improved:**
  - The Remix integration feature doesn't stand out from other features
  - Visual hierarchy could be stronger with more variation in card sizes
  - Title typography could be more impactful
  - Card layout is visually uniform, making it harder to emphasize key features
- **General notes:**
  This design iteration proposes a "Featured Card" approach where the Remix integration card spans two grid spaces, creating a visual focal point. By increasing its visual weight, we draw attention to this new capability while maintaining the overall grid structure. The title typography would be enhanced with a stronger gradient effect and slightly larger size.

#### Rating: 7/10
