# Design Principles for jods Documentation

## Core Design Principles

When creating design iterations for the jods documentation, consider these core principles:

1. **Developer-Centric** - Prioritize clarity and functionality that appeals to developers
2. **Code-Forward** - Give prominence to code examples and syntax highlighting
3. **Visual Hierarchy** - Create clear distinctions between different levels of information
4. **Accessibility** - Ensure designs work well for all users regardless of ability
5. **Theme Consistency** - Maintain parity between light and dark themes
6. **Brand Identity** - Reflect jods' identity as a minimal, reactive state library

## Design Elements to Consider

When iterating on designs, consider modifying these elements:

### Typography

- Font size, weight, and family for different content types
- Line height and spacing for code blocks vs. prose
- Font pairing between headings and body text

### Color

- Primary, secondary, and accent color usage
- Code syntax highlighting schemes
- Background gradients and surfaces
- Color meaning (success, error, warning)

### Layout

- Card and container shapes and shadows
- Spacing between elements
- Grid and flex layouts
- Responsive behavior

### Interactive Elements

- Button and link styling
- Hover and focus states
- Tabs and navigation components
- Code copy buttons

### Code Presentation

- Syntax highlighting themes
- Terminal/editor styling
- Line numbers and annotations
- Code container styling

## Design Patterns for Documentation

These patterns work well for technical documentation:

1. **Feature Cards** - Concise, visually distinct cards highlighting key features
2. **Code/Result Pairing** - Show code alongside its output/result
3. **Progressive Disclosure** - Hide complexity but make it accessible when needed
4. **Framework Tabs** - Use tabs to show the same concept across different frameworks
5. **IDE-Like Experience** - Mimic code editors for familiarity
6. **Visual Metaphors** - Use visual elements that reinforce technical concepts

## Implementation Guidelines

When implementing design changes:

1. Use CSS variables for consistent theming
2. Maintain mobile responsiveness
3. Optimize font loading for performance
4. Keep CSS specificity low for maintainability
5. Comment complex CSS with explanations
6. Use semantic HTML for accessibility

## Evaluating Design Success

Measure the success of design iterations by:

1. **Clarity** - Does it make technical concepts easier to understand?
2. **Engagement** - Does it invite deeper exploration?
3. **Memorability** - Does it create distinctive visual associations?
4. **Consistency** - Does it feel part of a cohesive system?
5. **Performance** - Does it maintain or improve page load times?
6. **Accessibility** - Does it work for all users?

## Design Anti-Patterns to Avoid

1. **Overdesigning** - Adding visual flourish that distracts from content
2. **Poor Contrast** - Making text difficult to read
3. **Inconsistent Navigation** - Changing how users move through the site
4. **Framework Favoritism** - Visually privileging one framework over others
5. **Desktop-Only Design** - Not considering mobile users
6. **Slow Load Times** - Adding heavy animations or large assets
